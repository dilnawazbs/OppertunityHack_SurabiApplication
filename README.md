# Surabi-Trust
Make a difference to the lives of children by creating a mentoring platform to connect urban children to rural children, and help them to share their lives, experiences and make a connection. 

Statement:
Our purpose is to connect a needy beneficiary to a PAL and a mentor, to facilitate the needy child development. Here we are trying to connect two children, a needy (from rural), and a PAL from urban (or well-off contributor). A mentor, who is a guardian of the PAL, helps the beneficiary in his academic/sports progress. We are building a solution to provide real time feedback to provide best utilization of the resources to beneficiary and motivation for mentor.

Solution:
We are going to develop a web based solution that can help in connecting the children and managing them. It will also facilitate that PAL and mentoring is being used efficiently by taking feedbacks from Mentor time to time.
